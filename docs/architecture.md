# Technical Architecture

## Overview

The BJJ Gym Management Application is built using a modern web architecture with React on the frontend and Supabase as the backend service. This document outlines the key architectural decisions and system design.

### Key Components

1. **Authentication (auth/)**
   - Handles user authentication and authorization
   - Manages protected routes and access control
   - Uses Supabase Auth for secure authentication
   - Components: AuthForm, SignInForm, SignUpForm, ProtectedRoute

2. **Member Management (members/)**
   - Member profiles and information management
   - Belt progression tracking
   - Attendance records
   - Components: MemberList, MemberForm, MemberDetailsDrawer

3. **Curriculum Management (curriculum/)**
   - Technique organization and tracking
   - Belt requirements management
   - Progress tracking
   - Components: TechniqueList, BeltLevelProgress

4. **Financial Management (finances/)**
   - Revenue and expense tracking
   - Transaction history
   - Financial reporting
   - Components: TransactionHistory, RevenueChart

5. **Inventory Management (inventory/)**
   - Equipment and merchandise tracking
   - Stock level monitoring
   - Low stock alerts
   - Components: InventoryList, LowStockAlert

### Backend Architecture (Supabase)

1. **Database Schema**
   - Normalized PostgreSQL database design
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Real-time subscriptions for live updates

2. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Secure session management

3. **Storage**
   - File storage for member photos and documents
   - Secure access controls
   - CDN integration

## State Management

1. **React Context**
   - AuthContext for user authentication state
   - Global application state management

2. **Custom Hooks**
   - useMembers for member data operations
   - useRoles for role management
   - useForm for form handling

## Data Flow

1. **Client-Server Communication**
   - RESTful API calls using Supabase client
   - Real-time subscriptions for live updates
   - Optimistic updates for better UX

2. **Error Handling**
   - Centralized error handling
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Error boundary implementation

## Security

1. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Secure session management
   - Protected routes

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Row Level Security in database
   - Component-level access control

3. **Data Protection**
   - Input validation
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS protection

## Performance Optimization

1. **Code Splitting**
   - Route-based code splitting
   - Lazy loading of components
   - Dynamic imports

2. **Caching**
   - API response caching
   - Static asset caching
   - Optimistic updates

3. **Bundle Optimization**
   - Tree shaking
   - Minification
   - Compression

## Development Workflow

1. **Build Process**
   - Vite for fast development and building
   - TypeScript compilation
   - ESLint for code quality

2. **Testing**
   - Unit testing setup
   - Integration testing
   - End-to-end testing capability

3. **Deployment**
   - CI/CD pipeline ready
   - Environment configuration
   - Build optimization

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling capability
   - Performance monitoring
   - Load balancing readiness

2. **Feature Expansion**
   - Mobile app potential
   - API versioning
   - Third-party integrations

3. **Maintenance**
   - Logging and monitoring
   - Error tracking
   - Performance analytics
